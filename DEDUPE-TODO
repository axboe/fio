- Shifted dedup-able data.
  Allow for dedup buffer generation to shift contents by random number
  of sectors (fill the gaps with uncompressible data). Some storage
  subsystems modernized the deduplication detection algorithms to look
  for shifted data as well. For example, some databases push a timestamp
  on the prefix of written blocks, which makes the underlying data
  dedup-able in different alignment. FIO should be able to simulate such
  workload.

- Generation of similar data (but not exact).
  A rising trend in enterprise storage systems.
  Generation of "similar" data means random uncompressible buffers
  that differ by few(configurable number of) bits from each other.
  The storage subsystem usually identifies the similar buffers using
  locality-sensitive hashing or other methods.
