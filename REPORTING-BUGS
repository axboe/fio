Reporting a bug
---------------

If you're contemplating reporting issues with deliberately constructed job
files that cause the parser to crash, then only do so if you also intend
to fix the issue. Legitimate job files that cause parsing issues should of
course be reported, however please don't waste our time with maliciously
constructed job files that cause double frees, fio crashes, or other effects
of that nature.

...via the mailing list
=======================

If you notice anything that seems like a fio bug or want to ask fio related
questions, please send a plain-text only email to the list
(fio@vger.kernel.org, see README) about it. If you are not running the newest
release of fio please upgrade first.

When reporting a bug, you'll need to include:

1) A description of what you think the bug is
2) Environment (e.g. Linux distro version, kernel version). This is mostly
   needed if it's a build bug.
3) The output from fio --version .
4) How to reproduce. Please include a full list of the parameters
   passed to fio and the job file used (if any).

A bug report can't have too much information. Any time information that
is left out and has to be asked for will add to the turn-around time
of getting to the bottom of the issue, and an eventual fix.

That's it!

...via GitHub issues
====================

Please create an issue in the GitHub issue tracker
(https://github.com/axboe/fio/issues ) but observe the following:

a) If you are asking a question on how to do something ("How do I/Why is?")
   please send it to the mailing list and not GitHub issues. The fio project
   uses GitHub issues for reproducible bugs/enhancement requests.
b) Please reproduce your bug using the latest fio listed on
   https://github.com/axboe/fio/releases (see the Source and Building sections
   of the README for how to build fio from source).
c) Include all of the information requested in the mailing list section above
   (description, environment, version, reproduction steps and all job parameters).

Thanks!
