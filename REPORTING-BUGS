Reporting a bug
---------------

If you notice anything that seems like a fio bug, please do send email
to the list (fio@vger.kernel.org, see README) about it. You'll need
to report at least:

1) A description of what you think the bug is
2) Environment (Linux distro version, kernel version). This is mostly
   needed if it's a build bug.
3) The fio version. The most useful is the git top level commit, you
   can find out by doing a cat .git/HEAD from the top level fio directory.
4) How to reproduce. Please include a full list of the parameters
   passed to fio and the job file used (if any).

That's it!
