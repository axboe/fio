 * libmtd - MTD library description data structure.
 * @sysfs_mtd: MTD directory in sysfs
 * @mtd: MTD device sysfs directory pattern
 * @mtd_dev: MTD device major/minor numbers file pattern
 * @mtd_name: MTD device name file pattern
 * @mtd_type: MTD device type file pattern
 * @mtd_eb_size: MTD device eraseblock size file pattern
 * @mtd_size: MTD device size file pattern
 * @mtd_min_io_size: minimum I/O unit size file pattern
 * @mtd_subpage_size: sub-page size file pattern
 * @mtd_oob_size: MTD device OOB size file pattern
 * @mtd_region_cnt: count of additional erase regions file pattern
 * @mtd_flags: MTD device flags file pattern
 * @sysfs_supported: non-zero if sysfs is supported by MTD
 * @offs64_ioctls: %OFFS64_IOCTLS_SUPPORTED if 64-bit %MEMERASE64,
 *                 %MEMREADOOB64, %MEMWRITEOOB64 MTD device ioctls are
 *                 supported, %OFFS64_IOCTLS_NOT_SUPPORTED if not, and
 *                 %OFFS64_IOCTLS_UNKNOWN if it is not known yet;
 *
 *  Note, we cannot find out whether 64-bit ioctls are supported by MTD when we
 *  are initializing the library, because this requires an MTD device node.
 *  Indeed, we have to actually call the ioctl and check for %ENOTTY to find
 *  out whether it is supported or not.
 *
 *  Thus, we leave %offs64_ioctls uninitialized in 'libmtd_open()', and
 *  initialize it later, when corresponding libmtd function is used, and when
 *  we actually have a device node and can invoke an ioctl command on it.
