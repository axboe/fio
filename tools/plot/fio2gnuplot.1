.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfio2gnuplot\fP analyze a set of fio's log files to turn them into a set of graphical traces using gnuplot tool.
Several flavor of plotting are produced
.TP
.B
Individual 2D Graph
Each file is plotted in a separate image file with several option
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
raw : Plot the exact reported performance. This plotting could be difficult to read
.IP \(bu 3
smooth :a smoother version of the raw print
Using csplines option of gnuplot, the rendering is
filtered to get an easier to read graph.
.IP \(bu 3
trend : an even smoother version of the raw print to get trends
Bezier's curves makes much more filtered plots
The resulting graph helps at understanding trends.
.RE
.TP
.B
Grouped 2D graph
All files are plotted in a single image to ease the comparison. The same rendering options as per the individual 2D graph are used :
.RS
.IP \(bu 3
raw
.IP \(bu 3
smooth
.IP \(bu 3
trend
.RE
.TP
.B
Grouped 3D graph
All files are plotted into a single 3D graph.
The 3D plotting generates a 'surface' to estimate how close were
the performance.
A flat surface means a good coherency between traces.
A rugged surface means a lack of coherency between traces
.TP
.B
Mathemical Plotting
.RS
.TP
.B
Average graph
A bar graph to show the average performance of each file.
A green line is added to show the global average performance.
This green line helps at understanding how far from the average is
every individual file.
.TP
.B
Min graph
A green line is added to show the global average of minimal performance.
This green line helps at understanding how far from the average is
every individual file.
.TP
.B
Max graph
A bar graph to show the maximum performance of each file.
A green line is added to show the global average of maximal performance.
This green line helps at understanding how far from the average is
every individual file.
.TP
.B
Standard Deviation
A bar graph to show the standard deviation of each file.
A green line is added to show the global average of standard deviation.
This green line helps at understanding how far from the average is
every individual file.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B
\fB-h\fP or \fB--help\fP
The option \fB-h\fP displays help
.TP
.B
\fB-p\fP '\fIpattern\fP' or --\fIpattern\fP '\fIpattern\fP'
A \fIpattern\fP in regexp to select fio input files.
Don't forget the simple quotes to avoid shell's interactions
.TP
.B
\fB-b\fP or \fB--bandwidth\fP
A predefined \fIpattern\fP for selecting *_bw.log files
.TP
.B
\fB-i\fP or \fB--iops\fP
A predefined \fIpattern\fP for selecting *_iops.log files
.TP
.B
\fB-g\fP or \fB--gnuplot\fP
Render gnuplot traces before exiting
.TP
.B
\fB-o\fP file or --\fIoutputfile\fP file
The basename for gnuplot traces (set with the \fIpattern\fP if defined)
.TP
.B
\fB-d\fP dir or \fB--outputdir\fP dir
The directory where gnuplot shall render files.
.TP
.B
\fB-t\fP \fItitle\fP or --\fItitle\fP \fItitle\fP
The \fItitle\fP of the gnuplot traces.
Title is set with the block size detected in fio trace
.TP
.B
\fB-G\fP \fItype\fP or \fB--Global\fP \fItype\fP
Search for '\fItype\fP' in .global files match by a \fIpattern\fP.
Available types are : min, max, avg, stddev.
The .global extension is added automatically to the \fIpattern\fP
.TP
.B
\fB-m\fP time or --\fImin_time\fP time
Only consider data starting from 'time' seconds. Default is 0
.TP
.B
\fB-M\fP time or --\fImax_time\fP time
Only consider data ending before 'time' seconds. Default is \fB-1\fP aka nolimit
.TP
.B
\fB-v\fP or \fB--verbose\fP
Increasing verbosity
.TP
.B
\fB-k\fP or \fB--keep\fP
Keep all temporary files from gnuplot's output dir
.SH EXAMPLE
.TP
.B
To plot all the traces named like 'host*_read_4k_iops.log'
$ \fBfio2gnuplot\fP \fB-p\fP 'host*_read_4k_iops.log' \fB-g\fP
.TP
.B
To plot all IO oriented log files from the current directory
$ \fBfio2gnuplot\fP \fB-g\fP \fB-i\fP
.TP
.B
To plot all Bandwidth oriented log files from the current directory
$ \fBfio2gnuplot\fP \fB-g\fP \fB-b\fP
.TP
.B
To plot all Bandwidth oriented log files in a directory name 'outdir'
$ \fBfio2gnuplot\fP \fB-g\fP \fB-b\fP \fB-d\fP outdir
