# ROCm does not list shlibs deps across almost all libraries.
# We will manually list the ROCm deps here to satisfy the build process.
# Format: <soname> <major_version> <package_dependencies>
# Note: Everything after `major_version` gets put into `package_dependencies`
#       and follows the syntax of the `Depends:` field of the control file.
