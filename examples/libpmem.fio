# In case of 'scramble_buffers=1', the source buffer
# is rewritten with a random value every write operations.

# But when 'scramble_buffers=0' is set, the source buffer isn't
# rewritten. So it will be likely that the source buffer is in CPU
# cache and it seems to be high performance.

# The libpmem engine does IO to files in a DAX-mounted filesystem.
# The filesystem should be created on an NVDIMM (e.g /dev/pmem0)
# and then mounted with the '-o dax' option.  Note that the engine
# accesses the underlying NVDIMM directly, bypassing the kernel block
# layer, so the usual filesystem/disk performance monitoring tools such
# as iostat will not provide useful data.
