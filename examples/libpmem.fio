# The pmemblk engine does IO to files in a DAX-mounted filesystem.
# The filesystem should be created on an NVDIMM (e.g /dev/pmem0)
# and then mounted with the '-o dax' option.  Note that the engine
# accesses the underlying NVDIMM directly, bypassing the kernel block
# layer, so the usual filesystem/disk performance monitoring tools such
# as iostat will not provide useful data.
