# Unlink can be used to remove the files when done, but if you are
# using serial runs with stonewall, and you want the files to be created
# only once and unlinked only at the very end, then put the unlink=1
# in the last group.  This is the method demonstrated here.
#
# Note that if you have a read-only group and if the files will be
# newly created, then all of the data will read back as zero and the
# read will be optimized, yielding performance that is different from
# that of reading non-zero blocks (or unoptimized zero blocks).

#
# The pmemblk engine does IO to files in a DAX-mounted filesystem.
# The filesystem should be created on an NVDIMM (e.g /dev/pmem0)
# and then mounted with the '-o dax' option.  Note that the engine
# accesses the underlying NVDIMM directly, bypassing the kernel block
# layer, so the usual filesystem/disk performance monitoring tools such
# as iostat will not provide useful data.
#
# Here we specify a test file on each of two NVDIMMs.  The first
# number after the file name is the block size in bytes (4096 bytes
# in this example).  The second number is the size of the file to
# create in MiB (1 GiB in this example); note that the actual usable
# space available to fio will be less than this as libpmemblk requires
# some space for metadata.
#
# Currently, the minimum block size is 512 bytes and the minimum file
# size is about 17 MiB (these are libpmemblk requirements).
#
# While both files in this example have the same block size and file
# size, this is not required.
