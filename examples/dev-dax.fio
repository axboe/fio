#
# The dev-dax engine does IO to DAX device that are special character
# devices exported by the kernel (e.g. /dev/dax0.0). The device is
# opened normally and then the region is accessible via mmap. We do
# not use the O_DIRECT flag because the device is naturally direct
# access. The O_DIRECT flags will result in failure. The engine
# access the underlying NVDIMM directly once the mmapping is setup.
#
# Check the alignment requirement of your DAX device. Currently the default
# should be 2M. Blocksize (bs) should meet alignment requirement.
#
# An example of creating a dev dax device node from pmem:
# ndctl create-namespace --reconfig=namespace0.0 --mode=dax --force
#
filename=/dev/dax0.0
