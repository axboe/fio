# Sample job file demonstrating how to use zoned random distributionss
# to have skewed random accesses. This example has 50% of the accesses
# to the first 5% of the file (50/5), 30% to the next 15% (30/15), and
# finally 20% of the IO will end up in the remaining 80%.

# The above applies to all of reads/writes/trims. If we wanted to do
# something differently for writes, let's say 50% for the first 10%
# and 50% for the remaining 90%, we could do it by adding a new section
# after a a comma.
