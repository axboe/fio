# Example test for the HTTP engine's S3 support against Amazon AWS.
# Obviously, you have to adjust the S3 credentials; for this example,
# they're passed in via the environment.
# For non-AWS S3 implementations, refer to your S3 vendor's region 
# settings. Note that the region value appears twice, in http_host and 
# http_s3_region.
# This example uses virtual-hosted-style requests:
# https://bucket-name.s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/k/e.y
# For path-style, prefix the key with the bucket name in the filename
# so that filename=/bucket-name/k/e.y:
# https://s3.region-code.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/k/e.y

# Reference for Virtual-hosted-style vs. Path-style URLs:
# https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html
